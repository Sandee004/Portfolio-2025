        Voterz is an online voting platform made to efficiently handle
        intra-business elections eg elections for a post in a school or
        organisation. It makes a better alternative to voting in person and then
        eases the stress of currating reults after the voting process. Voterz is
        made to make election seamless and user friendly. If election process is
        less tedious, more people would want to partake reducing political
        apathy even in our organizations. There would be no issue of cheating or
        foul play since all voting process would be done with the web app and
        gives the result.
